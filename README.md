Need to dos: deploy to zeit
write doc and comments explaining what has been done/how/why
add about page that includes doc (also react router)

ideas:
Generation checkboxes- 
    allow loading/displaying of each generation. 
    if checked for first time load and save to local storage. 
    update counts. 
    separate generations with styling (div outline)
search by id? useful?
filter by type?
character animations?
Routes to more detailed pokemon pages? click on image -> single page/expand card to see all stats provided by pokeApi. could easily save the whole object on axios get if not already doing so
